# Ride With Me Project
Ride sharing app

As a 4th year students, we have noticed that there is problem for some of us to get to and from the university. 
The bus stations are overloaded with more students that are trying to get a ride than those who are waiting for an actual bus. 
In our work we will try to provide a useful and convenient solution for the 'public of hitchhikers'. 
Our goal is to develop an app that will focus on sharing information of those who need a ride and those who can provide it.

The 'hitchhiker' app will be written in JAVA. The development tool will be 'Android Studio' & For Backend we will use Firebase.
We will put an emphasize on the convenience of the user and the speed of getting and sharing the information between both sides.
The convenience of the user will be measured by features that specific to the system, like:
*  Determination of the optimal route for collecting and distributing hitchhikers.
*  Build a hitch system with a possibility of  "connection".
*  Collecting partial payment for the drive .
*  Reference to casual ride and regularly ride.
*  Considering the profile of the driver and the hitchhiker to create a common drive (social aspect).
